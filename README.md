# For recruiters

This is my curriculum vitae. It is based on a common, machine-readable data format named JSON and is automatically rendered to PDF and a website on every update of this data. You can take a look at the result on https://ci.appveyor.com/project/saxx/resume/build/artifacts.

Contact me with interesting offers for a more detailled résumé  if this seems useful to you or your client. 


# For developers

This is my curriculum vitae in [JSON Resume format](https://jsonresume.org). Changes are automatically built and published as part of a continuous integration process on [AppVeyor](http://appveyor.com). Take a look at the source if you want to know more.

The latest build artifacts (my résumé in HTML and PDF format using different themes) is available at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/saxx/resume/build/artifacts. [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6yuxp2vf0g0aatwi?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/saxx/resume)

All you see here is inspired by https://github.com/sedouard/resume. Take a look at the repo there on information on how to get it running on Azure Websites.
