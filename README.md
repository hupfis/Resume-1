# For recruiters

This is my curriculum vitae. It is based on a common, machine-readable data format named JSON and is automatically rendered to PDF and a website on every update of this data. You can download the result from [GitHub](https://github.com/saxx/Resume/releases).

Contact me with interesting offers for a more detailled résumé  if this seems useful to you or your client. 


# For developers

This is my curriculum vitae defined using [JSON Resume format](https://jsonresume.org). The JSON Resume command-line interface "compiles" the JSON to HTML and PDF format. Changes in the JSON are automatically picked up, built and published as part of a continuous integration process on [AppVeyor](http://appveyor.com). Take a look at the source if you want to know more.

The latest build artifacts (ie. my résumé in HTML and PDF format using different themes) is available at [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/saxx/resume/build/artifacts)  as well as on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/saxx/Resume/releases)

All you see here is inspired by [Steven Edouard](http://resume.stevenedouard.com/). Take a look at [his repository](https://github.com/sedouard/resume) for some more detailled information, especially on how to run this on Azure Websites and listen to [this podcast](http://hanselminutes.com/457/starting-with-continuous-integration-in-the-cloud-with-steven-edouard) if you want some background information.
